## A Ninja Based Angular Javascript Project

I used this project as a first step in getting accustomed to Angular. 

If you'd like to have a look at this project, there's a couple of things you'll need to do.

Firstly, you'll have to download the source-code from this Angular_Ninja repository. 

The Angular JS framework, and the additional modules (namel, the routing and animating modules are included in the download).

Really, the only thing you'll have to do after downloading the content is to ensure you have access to a live server to run the project - **it cannot be run in a simple browser such as Chrome or Safari**.

So, my suggestion is to download and install [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then use the [**npm live-server**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

The server can be installed globally:

```npm install -g live-server``` 

Then, in the directory where you placed the above repository download, issue the command:

```live-server```

This will automatically launch your default browser with all the files from the repository available. 

Click on **_index.html** and start having pointless fun with Ninjas.

It's particularly pointless when there's no associated database or back-end whatsoever - I might build that in the not too distant future.
